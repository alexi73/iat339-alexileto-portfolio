            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Alexandra Ileto and I am a digital designer specializing in motion graphics design, social media design, and video editing. I grew up fascinated by how technology can be used to express creativity through videos, magazine layouts, illustrations, etc. Programs such as Figma, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects have become my playground for me to experiment with to create designs that resonate with people. Creating dynamic and accessible designs that excite and inspire anyone looking is what drives me to design.</p>
